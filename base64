# Encoding files you can't transfer or view

Sometimes a command line shell prevents you from viewing PDF or JPG. Files that normally requires a GUI.

A good idea is to encode the file in base64, copy and paste the output and decode it on another workstation.

1. Encode the document

  user@remote~$ base64 new.pdf
  ...
  <output>
  ...

2. Copy the output

3. Put the output in a local file

  root@localhost~# echo '<output>' > encoded.new.pdf
  
4. Decode the file

  root@localhost~# base64 -d local.new.pdf  > decoded.new.pdf
  
Use your favorite browser to open the pdf file.
